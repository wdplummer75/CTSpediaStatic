Agenda 
9:00 AM \x96 9:10 AM  Welcome and Introductions (Led by: Ken, Brenda, Mat, and George)
<p></p>
9:10 AM \x96 10:30 AM Subgroup Reports
Objective: Each subgroup should prepare a 20 minute presentation of the status or their progress including a short list of the most important clinical questions and which are the best graphs to address them. Subgroups should also prepare what hurdles need to be addressed. These presentations will highlight achievements of each subgroup and serve as a basis for discussions on next steps to complete the project.
9:10 AM \x96 9:30 AM: Labs/Liver (Presenter: Mac Gordon)
9:30 AM \x96 9:50 AM: ECG/Vitals (Presenter:  Rich Anziano)
9:50 AM \x96 10:10 AM: General AE\x92s (Presenter: Janelle Charles)
10:10 AM \x96 10:30 AM: General Principles (Presenter: Rich Forshee or Fabrice Bancken)
<p></p>
10:30 AM \x96 10:50 AM Wiki Demonstration (Presenter: Mary Banach)
Objective: This will be a live demonstration of the graphic form that needs to be filled in for each graphic. It will also cover various other features of the wiki to display materials developed by the group as well as an overview of the site architecture and where things are located.
<p></p>
10:50 AM \x96 12:15 PM Consensus Agreements (Led by Mat Soukup)
Objective: This part of the agenda will discuss what to include and how to organize materials on a subgroup page. We will also discuss if a process is needed for finalizing an individual graphic to be contributed by the working group. Will there be a distinction between working group contributed graphics and those contributed by external people? This will be working towards reaching an end state of the development and display of graphics for our working group efforts. 
<p></p>
12:15 PM \x96 1:15 PM Lunch (on campus)
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
1:15 PM \x96 1:45 PM Engaging External Stakeholders (Led by Mat Soukup)
Objective: For this topic we will discuss how to engage external stakeholders. Topics to be discussed:
&#61607; Development of computing code to create the graphics.
&#61607; Should materials/working group agreed upon graphics and/or subgroup pages be read only or should these be allowed to evolve over time (i.e. read/write privileges to external participation) by people outside of the working group? 
&#61607; How materials will be included on the wiki from members outside of the working group which relates to the level of \x93openness\x94 of materials contributed by the group.
&#61607; How to have the wiki structured to display content developed by the working group as well as that contributed by external people.
&#61607; How will others contribute content to \x93open\x94 areas of the wiki. Are there easy ways for them to do so?
<p></p>
1:45 PM \x96 2:15 PM Communications (Led by George Rochester)
Objective: For this topic we will discuss how to communicate achievements of the group such as completion of the project, presentations at professional meetings, development of training materials that can be used at participant\x92s organizations.
<p></p>
2:15 PM \x96 2:45 PM  Timelines (Led by Ken Koury)
Objective: This will be a discussion on developing a set of rough timelines on when to reach certain milestones as set forth in the consensus topic. The preliminary set of milestones includes:
&#61607; Finalization of the top X set of graphics for each subgroup.
&#61607; Finalization of subgroup pages.
&#61607; Finalize organization of the wiki.
<p></p>
2:45 PM \x96 3:15 PM Considerations for Moving the Group to an Umbrella Organization (Led by Brenda Crowe)
Objective: This topic will further discuss organizing ourselves under an umbrella organization. This will include reasons for organizing under an umbrella organization and how such an organization would impact the working group. Suggestions/proposals for specific organizations and what is required should be addressed by the proposer. 
<p></p>
3:15 PM \x96 3:30 PM Wrap up (Led by Ken, Brenda, Mat, and George)
A summary of the meeting will be provided along with a discussion on long-term plans for the working group.

Meeting Minutes
Date:   Monday, August 22, 2011
Time:             2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
<p></p>
Discussion of Agenda Items:
<p></p>
1.  Issues carried over from July 23 meeting
Rich Anziano raised the question of posting slide decks from presentations by group members to the CTSPedia website.  Mary Banach indicated that Mat Soukup had set up a template and that members should let her know about any problems they encounter using it.  Although there are several links to this location, Mary suggested going to the CTSPedia home page and clicking on the Presentations Archive link (in the Help for Biostatisticians section, below the Statistical Graphics link).  Then you can view the presentations that are currently there, or click on Attach to upload a new presentation. Presenters at the meetings are encouraged to post their slides in this location \x96 if they have questions, they should ask Mary for help. In addition to slides being posted, session abstracts would also be nice to include for each professional meeting.
<p></p>
<p></p>
2.  JSM Sessions
Ken Koury and speakers from the JSM sessions organized by Susan Duke/Fabrice Banken and Brenda Crowe reported that the presentations were well-received and that the topics generated a lot of interest and discussion from the audience.  Brenda also indicated that the DIA session in June was very well-attended.  Common questions from the sessions that will be good topics for our face-to-face meeting in September were how to allow vendors to contribute to advancing our project and how to communicate the availability of the website to external users when we believe that it is ready.

<em>Below is a proposal for a process to enter graphics on the site</em>:
<p></p>
<strong>Process for each Subteam (ECG/Vitals, Labs/Liver, General AE&rsquo;s) to Populate the Wiki</strong>
<p></p>
The wiki will consist of a general data base of graphics along with a specific home page for each subteam. Each graphic entry in the data base will contain the meta data described in the form/template seen here (<a href="http://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/ContributeGraphics#Contributing_Individual_Graphs_U">http://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/ContributeGraphics#Contributing_Individual_Graphs_U</a>). The following is a proposal for entering graphics into the wiki.
<p></p>
Note that graphics can be in two states. The first is for graphics which were developed by a working group member or those in which the working group can get access to source information (e.g. code and data). The second is for those graphics which were identified from external media (e.g. meeting presentations, websites, publications, etc.)
<p></p>
<strong>Graphics with source information</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Stage 1</strong>: Subteam Consensus and Development
<p></p>
Within a subteam, graphs that have been decided upon to be useful for addressing a specific clinical question in the domain of interest should be developed in a finalized form. For each graphic this would entail the following.
<p></p>
<strong>1.</strong> An electronic representation of the graphic (i.e. JPG format).
<p></p>
<strong>2.</strong> Coding to reproduce the graphic using either a data set that can be publicly accessed (e.g. CDISC data sets) or a simulated data set.
<p></p>
<strong>3.</strong> Filling out all sections of the form.
<p></p>
<strong>4.</strong> Entering the graphic entry into the wiki data base.
<p></p>
The subteam should evaluate each entry and concur on its readiness for the next stage.
<p></p>
<strong>Stage 2</strong>: General Group Consensus
<p></p>
After a subteam has entered a graphic entry into the wiki data base and the subteam agrees on its readiness, the whole working group should be informed of its entry into the data base. The working group should then review the entry and propose any potential modifications. After the whole group has had an opportunity to review the graphic entry and all changes have been incorporated, it will be deemed complete.
<p></p>
<strong>Graphics with NO source information</strong>
<p></p>
<em>Needs to be determined/discussed</em>.

<strong>Points of Discussion</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Subgroup Meeting Minutes</strong>
<p></p>
Communications &ndash;George Rochester discussed the groups first meeting. <ul>
<li> Had first meeting and at this time would like to get clarity on what the communication groups charge should be.  <ul>
<li> How to market the group o How to link with other groups and websites
</li> <li> Targeted Activities  <ul>
<li> Launching of the website Launch Date Launch date was initially targeted for June 1, 2011
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> June 1, 2011 is not a reasonable launch date for the graphs and clinical questions. A sub-team will be formed in order to agree upon what information should be launched, and report back to the larger group.
</li></ul> 
Content Volunteers were requested for a sub-team to organize the website and decide what type of information will be presented.  <ul>
<li> Brenda Crowe, Mac Gordon, Rich Forshee, and Mary Banach volunteered
</li> <li> A conference call will be scheduled during the following week.  <ul>
<li> If there is enough time, this sub-team will also sketch out the tasks needed and a timeline.  <ul>
<li> Flow Chart
</li> <li> Class Graphs
</li> <li> Safety Graphs
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> How should the safety aspects be emphasized?
</li> <li> How should these graphs be linked to the clinical questions?
</li> <li> The format for data are either .xpt or .csv
</li> <li> Programming is not required at this time.
</li></ul> 
Sub-team Goals and Content for Launch Each subgroup will draft a schedule and timeline. Describing goals and what would be acceptable for launch in the lieu of meeting all of their goals.  <ul>
<li> Overall aim of the subgroup versus what can be achieved by the next month.  <ul>
<li> What the subgroup is willing to launch?
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
Review Process for graphs:  <ul>
<li> Each group posts graphs and members review and mark either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;  <ul>
<li> The 8 principles from the General principles group should guide the member&rsquo;s decision in choosing whether or not a graph is appropriate.
</li> <li> Clinical judgments o Whether the graph is meeting a need.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
Discussion of Coding and Data Sets It is not necessary to post new data sets, only link in the code to restructure it.  <ul>
<li> Methods for solving the data structure issues:  <ol>
<li> Attach as a separate file using the attach button at the top of the wiki
</li> <li> Cut and paste the code into the form.
</li> <li> If a graph can be created using a &ldquo;point and click&rdquo; method, describe the graph and the group will work on the code at a later date.
</li></ol> 
</li></ul> 
Planning of a Face-to-Face meeting on September 22, 2011  <ul>
<li> CDER WO Adverse Events &ndash; Janelle Charles gave a summary of the group&rsquo;s last meeting.
</li></ul> 
ECG and Vitals &ndash; Rich Anziano gave a summary of the group&rsquo;s last meeting. The group met on April 12, 2011 There are several note-worthy documents on the wiki  <ul>

<strong>Points of Discussion</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Proposal of a New Member</strong>
<p></p>
Michael O&rsquo;Connell from Tibco. <ul>
<li> The inclusion of vendors presents difficulty with regard to FDA Regulations. There is a rigorous legal process involved with establishing a CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement). To otherwise include a single vendor could result in criticism for not providing equal access.  <ul>
<li> An open invitation for all vendors to come and attend as consultants would be appropriate.
</li> <li> Group consensus: membership will not be extended to vendors.
</li> <li> During the roll-out phase vendors will be a part of the groups outreach.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<strong>Subgroup Meeting Minutes</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Adverse Events</strong> &ndash; Stephine Keeton gave a summary of the group&rsquo;s last meeting. <ul>
<li> The Adverse Events Subgroup met on February 24, 2011
</li> <li> The purpose of the meeting was to continue discussing graphs.  <ul>
<li> This discussion of graphs will continue during the March and April subgroup meetings.
</li> <li> Once the discussion is completed, a clinical questions and graphics document will be completed by the June meeting and posted to ctspedia for comment from the general group.
</li> <li> Draft graphs are available on the wiki under AE graphs.
</li> <li> A draft document is not available yet.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<strong>ECG and Vitals</strong> &ndash; Rich Anziano gave a summary of the group&rsquo;s last meeting.  <ul>
<li> The ECG and Vitals Subgroup met on February 10, 2011
</li> <li> Norm Stockbridge is formally assigning a clinician to review the questions and the corresponding graphics.
</li> <li> Data will either be simulated or anonymized.  <ul>
<li> No public ECG data supply available.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Fabrice, George, and Rich are participating in a session at ISBIS in Berlin.  <ul>
<li> Discuss specific clinical questions and associated graphics the ECG group compiled.
</li> <li> Fabrice will speak more generally about the effort as a whole.
</li> <li> George will lead this session.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Once the data set is in order it will be available on the wiki.
</li></ul> 
<strong>General Principles</strong>- Susan Duke gave a summary of the group&rsquo;s last meeting.  <ul>
<li> The General Principles Subgroup met on February 17, 2011
</li> <li> <p> <strong>Attendees:</strong> Susan Duke (Chair), Mat Soukup, Mary Banach, Richard Forshee, Larry Gould, Qi Jiang, Fabrice Bancken, Brenda Crowe, Andreas Krause. </p><p> <strong>Agenda:</strong> (1) Demo proof of concept of the public wiki (Mary), (2) get feedback from team on the first conference presentation (Fabrice), (3) discuss actions needed and date for launching the public wiki (Mat). </p><p> <strong>Key Points:</strong> </p> <ol>
<li> The team had helpful feedback for Mary's proof of concept, which is now ready to be demo'd to the full group. There has been a lot of work to get this far, especially by Mary, Mat, and a number of folks from Vanderbilt. Link to (eventual) public site: <a href="CTSpedia.StatGraphHome" target="_top">http://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/StatGraphHome</a>
</li> <li> Fabrice received some useful feedback on his slides for the first conference. It was also recognized by many on the call that this first one will be helpful for subsequent conferences, as well as for what gets published on the wiki.
</li> <li> The focus of Mat's topic was the classes of graphs. These will be needed prior to launch. It was agreed these should be completed by end of March. A launch date for the public wiki itself was not discussed, as we ran out of time. So far, five people have volunteered to create some of the other classes needed. Other volunteers are welcomed! Link to table of class graphs needed: <a target="_top" href="CTSpedia.StatGraphHome#SeeBelow">http://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/StatGraphHome#SeeBelow</a>

</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<strong>General Principles</strong>- Susan Duke gave a summary of the group&rsquo;s last meeting.  <ul>
<li> Working through concepts within the wiki  <ul>
<li> Producing a hyperlink that links to certain points on a .pdf or <a title="Create this topic" href="PowerPoint.html" class="foswikiNewLink" rel="nofollow">PowerPoint</a> file e.g. a user may select a thumbnail and get more information. (Mary Banach has been working on this effort)
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Susan and Mary will discuss the progress and schedule more meetings for the General Principles subgroup shortly.
</li> <li> Principles being discussed include;  <ul>
<li> Placement of the figure #, title, and topic within the graph.
</li> <li> Footnotes on the bottom of the graph.
</li> <li> Details regarding the color.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Flush out the explanatory pieces that will serve as an intermediate step between Fabrice&rsquo;s general design figures and the actual graphics entry.
</li> <li> The thumbnails or Fabrice&rsquo;s figures would hyperlink the user to a more detailed page that would discuss that particular graph.
</li> <li> From the more detailed page the user could hyperlink to the graphics entries.
</li> <li> Mary Banach is currently working on the forms for these entries as well.
</li></ul> 
<strong>Open Discussion</strong>
<p></p>
1. Rich Forshee has been working with Mary Banach to figure out a way to load and present these intermediate graphs. Currently working on a Sandbox for this now and details will be available soon.
<p></p>
2. The next steps are for the subgroups to finalize the remaining graphics, and then work toward uploading them to the wiki.
<p></p>
3. The coding on the wiki doesn&rsquo;t have to be of a high-level immediately. This should be considered an evolving document. <ul>
<li> Come up with the graphic and provide the code to create a workable example.
</li> <li> Software vendors may be able to take it to the next level within their package, e.g. SAS clinical.
</li></ul> 
4. There is a plan for taking the ideas of the working group to different conferences. Is there a plan for other forms of communication when the project goes public?  <ul>
<li> Working group members can have a &ldquo;show and tell&rdquo; within their respective organizations. &bull; Journal
</li> <li> AMSTAT News
</li> <li> Trade publications
</li> <li> Letter to the editor
</li> <li> Tutorial a. With a tutorial there needs to be focus as to which users the group is targeting. b. The timeframe would be the next couple of months; once more mature materials have been posted.
</li> <li> The ASA Bio-pharmaceutical section&rsquo;s newsletter
</li></ul> 
5. The next step for subgroups would be to have a walk through of all their sections and show examples. Compile a joint effort where each group contributes one or two examples, to show the concepts.
<p></p>
6. A Communications subgroup should form to concentrate on items #4 and 5. <ul>
<li> George Rochester will lead the Communications Subgroup and seek 4 to 5 volunteers to help.
</li></ul> 
7. Launch date, this will be discussed at next months meeting. What items will comprise the launch?
<p></p>
8. Drug Information Journal review of <em>Drug Safety Data: How to Analyze, Summarize, and Interpret to Determine Risk</em> by Michael J. Klepper and Barton Cobert. The reviews are well, but unsure how quantitative it is.
<p></p>
9. DOT scripting language from the Graphbiz package <ul>
<li> A good way to save diagrams, especially flow-type charts. Also makes them easier to maintain, and add to later. A wiki plug-in exist for this.
</li> <li> Another competing system is Asymptote. A wiki plug-in does not exist for this system. This is a high-level picture drawing. Examples are in the gallery of the Asymptote website. <a href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/gallery/">http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/gallery/</a>

</li> <li> The group though has not gone away and is looking for a home under the DIA umbrella.
</li> <li> Would provide the advantage of being part of a larger statistical organization.  <ul>
<li> This group is a collection of statisticians with an interest in pharmaceutical applications that have regulatory implications. This is a good fit with DIA.
</li> <li> Joining a larger statistical organization prevents misconception of collusion. This is particularly an industry concern

<p></p>
<strong>Action Items from the previous meeting:</strong>
<p></p>
&bull; CTSpedia and the Subgroups Mary Banach will be to point of contact for technical questions <ul>
<li> Register on CTSpedia further instructions will be sent The Wiki will be the location for sharing information, as opposed to email attachments. -Each Subgroup should have there own page.  <ul>
<li> Within this page start subsections based on a graphic that will address a specific clinical question.
</li> <li> If there are issues programming graphics out, sketches can be scanned and submitted in jpeg format so it can be easily depicted on the site.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> This format will facilitate comments and further dialogue.  <ul>
<li> Each group should develop a template for when a finalized graph is produced; what type of information should be depicted, how are the graphs going to classified (long term goal not immediate).
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Data Sets small data sets acquired o
</li> <li> Pediatric Data Set &ndash; Leslie Kenna  <ul>
<li> Has the pediatric form body, and has a link.
</li> <li> Find a way to distribute this smaller data set.
</li> <li> Mat will look into how to distribute this and other data sets and if the wiki can accommodate this effort; and what restrictions exist.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Large Data Set &ndash; Brenda Crowe  <ul>
<li> Robust data set contains a good spectrum of safety data.
</li> <li> De-identified
</li> <li> Contains Adverse events and Labs.
</li> <li> Perhaps vitals, but no ECGs o Brenda will report the status of this effort to Mat, Bruce, and the team leads; and identify members to provide assistance.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Brenda will attempt to initiate a web conference between Mat and Greg.
</li> <li> Conferences/planned presentations o Mat has a presentation at the JSM Invited session for safety graphics. He will not comment specifically on what the group has devised. Mat will though mention; what the group is, what the membership is, and the specific goals to be achieved. This was put out to the membership and there were no objections.  <ul>
<li> FDA/Industry Workshop in September. Mat will discuss the constructs of forming the group, preliminary results, and will not get into content (this will be addressed at the ICSA meeting). The focus will be what it took to get the group formed, and what members have done.
</li> <li> Qi will attend the ICSA June 26 &ndash; 29, 2011 in New York, New York. This presentation will further advertise the group&rsquo;s efforts and pick up where the Mat left off at the FDA/Industry Workshop. Qi described the ICSA/JSM partnership.  <ul>
<li> <strong>Proposal:</strong> A session titled Innovative Drug Safety Graphical Presentation. Mat and Qi will organize this session and co-chair. There will be three speakers and one discussant or four speakers. Ideally the four speakers would be a lead or a delegate from the subgroups and speak for twenty minutes.  <ul>
<li> Brenda raised the point of if we should do this for other meetings as well, and if we should develop a template and distribute them widely.

<p></p>
<strong>Meeting Purpose:</strong> Introduction of working group members, charter finalization, major milestones for 2010, web-hosting, and documentation.
<p></p>
<strong>Points of Discussion</strong>
<p></p>
Charter finalization <ul>
<li> It was noted that the numbering in Section 1 is out of order and 1.2 is listed twice.
</li> <li> In section 1.4 should state &ldquo;exploration and reporting&rdquo;.  <ul>
<li> Perhaps these tools could identify safety problems;  <ul>
<li> Include exploration and reporting.
</li> <li> Better understanding in reporting.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Concerning the Project Scope in addition to ISS, exploratory graphs, and study reports.  <ul>
<li> Include that the static graphics should be printable.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> High Level Project Plan  <ul>
<li> Much of what will be developed will be useful to epidemiological studies.
</li> <li> The Charter may be adapted continuously.
</li> <li> As these tools are developed they aide in the production of new drugs. Should the Scope(1.4) reflect this.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Milestones  <ul>
<li> Remove &lsquo;Project Authority&rsquo; from the charter, leave only &lsquo;Milestones&rsquo; as the heading for Section 2.
</li> <li> Some major safety questions must be incorporated in 2.1.a.
</li> <li> Define 2.1.a.iii &ldquo;regulatory review and business processes&rdquo;  <ul>
<li> 2.1.a.iii should be its own sub-section, 2.1.e
</li> <li> What were the &ldquo;business process&rdquo;?  <ul>
<li> This was the basis to describe how to use the pallet effectively. Recommendations for implementation of future work streams. More detail is required.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> A discussion of 2.1.b &ldquo;Develop a palette of statistical graphics for specialized reporting of clinical trials data&rdquo; by Matt Soukup.  <ul>
<li> It is critical to development that data sets be submitted.  <ul>
<li> Users should be able to share how they have used graphics to display information.
</li> <li> Users should be able to submit data sets for information the do not know how to display.
</li> <li> New clinical data in CDISC format.
</li> <li> If any members of the working group have dummy data sets that could be used, they should submit them.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Members should discuss and share graphics they have.  <ul>
<li> This will require further discussion and assignments.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Points of discussion  <ol>
<li> How will these data sets be maintained, how will users contribute to this in the future?  <ul>
<li> Frank Harrell will address this in the future.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> What will be the standards for text and graphics? e.g.  <ul>
<li> Resolution and properties for graphics.
</li> <li> Rules for text
</li> <li> Something beyond rules to encourage better graphics.
</li> <li> When the wiki is used how will best practices be ensured?
</li> <li> There should be some regulation of content e.g. a review process.
</li> <li> An outline to describe best practices.
</li> <li> In addition to proper credit, a disclaimer should be included that this data has not been verified for a desired level of quality.  <ul>
<li> Contributors should not feel responsible if their name was attached to some code and it fails to run.
</li> <li> Legal will be involved.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Documentation  <ul>
<li> A statement of purpose should be included so users know how to interpret graphs.
</li> <li> In the interest of time Section 2.4 Major Project Deliverables will be assigned to a volunteer.  <ul>
<li> Qi Jiang Volunteered.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li></ol> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Section 3 Project Structure  <ul>
<li> Frank Harrell was asked if he could recommend any others in academia with interest in the groups effort. Rich Highburger at Temple University was recommended.
</li> <li> Vendors could be brought in but not as members so the group does not loose scope.
</li> <li> Section 3.1.2(d) Patient groups and health care providers.  <ol>
<li> Since these graphics may end up on a label, this group is important.
</li> <li> There are no group members from section 3.1.2(d); we may include them when there is content to present for the outreach/training.
</li></ol> 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<strong>Web-hosting</strong>  <ul>
<li> Frank Harrell  <ul>
<li> Web-hosting platform can do what is required.
</li> <li> Good statistical practice is not documented. This may be a good objective.
</li> <li> Develop a compendium of test data sets with specific data sets that reflect reality.
</li> <li> Collect simulation designs;  <ul>
<li> 4 period cross over designs
</li> <li> Dose studies
</li> <li> 2x2 designs
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> If this could be a community platform for sharing ideas, that would be an added benefit.
</li> <li> CTSpedia just moved to Vanderbilt, and can bring various areas of expertise.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<strong>Documentation</strong>  <ul>
