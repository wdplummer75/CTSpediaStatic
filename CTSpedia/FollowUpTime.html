Among 250 total subjects, 100 died during follow-up. Of the 150 not known to have died, 10 were lost to follow-up after a median of 2.5 years (range 0.4 to 5.1), and the remaining 140 were censored at the end of our follow-up period at 12/31/2007 with a median follow-up time of 3.7 years (range 2.0 to 6.9).

This diagram of a <a href="CensorData.html">hypothetical cohort</a> (from <a class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink" href="#SzkloEpi">Szklo and Nieto</a>) shows how individuals in a study usually start at different times but may drop out before the end of the study, or may experience the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">outcome</a> (e.g. death) before the end of the study.

<h2 id="Different_Follow_45up_Times">  Different Follow-up Times </h2>
 <strong>When calculating cumulative incidence in a cohort you must take into consideration:</strong>  <ul>
<li> Subjects have different starting dates.
</li> <li> Subjects have different follow-up after enrollment.
</li></ul> 
Having identical and complete follow-up on all subjects is the exception to the norm (See <a href="EgLostHCV.html">examples</a> of an HCV/HIV infected cohort). A typical cohort study may take months to years to recruit all of the participants.
<p></p>
<strong>Most <a href="StudyCohort.html">cohorts</a> have a single ending date but different starting dates for participants because of the recruitment process:</strong> <ul>
<li> This guarantees there will be unequal follow-up time.
</li> <li> In addition, it is very rare not to have drop outs.
</li></ul> 
Since most studies have a single ending date, subjects enrolled at the end of the recruiting process are going to have less follow-up time in the study than those enrolled at the beginning, even without having any subjects drop out, die, or be lost to follow-up. When those latter categories are also taken into account, there is usually great variation in how long different persons are observed in a cohort study. Aside from the variation in time followed, having individuals who are lost to follow-up are a major threat to the validity of conclusions about incidence. As we stressed last time, losses to follow-up are the primary problem in the validity of cohort studies.
<p></p>
Since cumulative incidence has to be defined as per some time period, it is incorrect to say, when follow-up times vary by individual. The cumulative incidence in a cohort study that ran for 3 years was the proportion with the diagnosis divided by the number enrolled in the study. For some subjects who were only in the study for 6 months or a year, it is the incidence for those time periods. So the problem is how to assign a time period to the cumulative incidence when persons are followed for different times.

<h2 id="Follow_45up_Starting_Times">  Follow-up Starting Times </h2>
<p></p>
To resolve the problem of different starting times, the analyst <strong>shifts all the starting times to the left</strong> as noted in the diagram below. For the analysis, each person is going to be started at the same time zero. <ul>
<li> This graph from <a href="#SzkloEpi" class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink">Szklo and Nieto</a> shows how the data look when all of the different calendar starting times are reassigned the same follow-up starting time.
</li> <li> We have inserted a C for the one person seen for the entire two years.
</li> <li> Note that the <strong>time axis</strong> is now follow-up time rather than calendar time.
</li></ul>

<h2 id="Calculating_Cumulative_Incidence_with_Differing_Follow_45up_Times">  Calculating Cumulative Incidence with Differing Follow-up Times </h2>
 <strong>The Problem:</strong> Since you rarely have equal follow-up on everyone, you cannot just divide number of events by the number who were initially at risk.
<p></p>
<strong>The Solution:</strong> <a href="KaplanMeier.html">Kaplan-Meier</a> and <a href="StudyAnalysisLife.html">life tables</a> are two methods devised to calculate cumulative incidence among persons with differing amounts of follow-up time
<p></p>
The two methods of solving this problem of calculating the <a href="StudyIncidenceCumul.html">cumulative incidence</a> for different amounts of follow-up are called the Kaplan-Meier and the life table method. The life table approach is much older but is seldom seen in the medical literature these days because the Kaplan-Meier method has become the standard. For large datasets life tables give the same answer as the Kaplan-Meier method.
