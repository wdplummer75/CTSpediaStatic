<p></p>
<font color="darkmagenta">This is a common type of problem in cohort studies that examine exposures which can change over time, such as smoking, changes in diet, exercise, medications, etc. The database records time periods when medications were being used and time periods when they were not used. Some persons will never use the medications and some will use it continuously, but there is a large group who either initiate or discontinue use during the time under study and another group who change in both directions. The same person can go on and off the medication multiple times. It is difficult to see how you would analyze such data using the cumulative incidence approach. </font>

<p></p> <ul>
<li> For persons followed in a cohort some potential risk factors may be <strong>fixed</strong> but some may be <strong>variable</strong>
</li> <li> gender is fixed; taking medications or getting regular exercise are behaviors that can change over time
</li> <li> Adding up person-time in an exposure category to get a denominator of time at risk is one way to deal with risk factors that change over time

<p></p>
<font color="darkmagenta">For exposures that are time-varying, adding up the total person-time of exposure and non-exposure to form two denominators is a very useful way of dealing with the problem of changing exposure groups. The numerators for each denominator then become the number of events that occurred among persons at times when they were exposed and similarly for the events among the unexposed. This approach assumes that the exposure&#8217;s effect on the event is predominately during the time the exposure is occurring. It therefore makes sense for exposures whose association with the outcome quickly disappears when the exposure is removed. This assumption would not work very well for exposures which have lasting effects long after the actual exposure is removed. For an exposure like smoking with known long-term health risks, linking events to time periods when an individual was and was not smoking would probably assume too close a relationship between the time of exposure and the outcome. </font>

</li> <li> Use of NSAIDs could change over 11 years of study: same person could be in both using and non-using group at different times
</li> <li> Could construct some fixed classification of persons as never, sometime, and frequent users and do cumulative incidence in each group.
</li></ul> 
<p></p>
<o:p> </o:p>
<p></p>
<font color="darkmagenta">Here is an example from a manuscript that analyzed Medicaid recipients in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:place></st1:state> over a ten-year period. In a prospective cohort with an exposure that can vary over time, subjects cannot be classified in groups by their amount of exposure at baseline because their future medication use cannot be known in advance. In a cohort analysis done retrospectively (such as this example) or at the end of follow-up in a prospective cohort, it is possible to classify individuals by some measure of total use, but such an approach would give a rather crude categorization (say, 2 or 3 groups) that doesn&#8217;t do a good job of distinguishing length of time of use, which may vary from months to years. <a title="Create this topic" href="IncidenceMove.html" class="foswikiNewLink" rel="nofollow">IncidenceMove</a> rates during times of use and non-use that account for time of exposure more accurately may be more informative, and they are easily calculated. The assumption is that NSAID use will have an immediate effect during usage in lowering the incidence of cardiovascular events.</font>

The following were censoring variables: death, reaching age 85, entry into a nursing home, life-threatening illness (other than CAD), or end of study. Subjects with no history of prior NANSAIDS use who began use after having been enrolled in the database for 365 days (in order to have data on prior illnesses) were compared with subjects not using NANSAIDS. A subject who stopped using was eligible to be in the non-using group later, but to avoid any carryover effect, only after 365 days of non-use had elapsed. </font>

<font color="darkmagenta">Ideally, this is a question that should be resolved by a clinical trial, but a clinical trial of this question may never be done. In the absence of a randomized trial, an observational cohort study is the second best choice. Again, a prospective cohort with better measurements of all the potential confounders, in particular aspirin use, would be preferable, but to get the numbers required would mean a very large cohort followed for a number of years. Possible but very expensive. Analyzing existing data is less desirable, but it does provide an opportunity to assemble a cohort analysis on a large number over many years at minimal expense. The question that remains is whether they were able to get adequate control of confounders.</font>

<font color="darkmagenta">The longer the follow-up period of an analysis, the greater the threat that changes in the underlying incidence rate of the outcome may be causing an estimate of cumulative incidence to be invalid. In this example, looking at cancer mortality in the nationwide NCI SEER program (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results), the researchers estimated that improvements in survival in more recent years would have resulted in a 20-year cumulative incidence of 51% survival rather than the 40% that the registry data actually show. </font>

<p></p>
<font color="darkmagenta">This is an example of analyzing data by calendar time cohorts. The analysis of biases in the cumulative incidence rates was performed by dividing the persons into 5-year cohorts based on the time period of their cancer diagnosis. This uses all cancer types in the SEER database. Done this way each more recent 5-year cohort has a 5-year shorter total follow-up time, but a clear trend toward overall improved survival appears. The top dotted line for the 1998 cohort is an extrapolation out to 20-years as there was at the time of the analysis no follow-up data on this group. So the estimate for the overall improvement in 20-year survival is the difference between the extrapolation of 1998 to 20 years versus the actual 20-year follow-up on the 1978 cohort.</font>

<font color="steelblue"> <strong>METHODS:</strong> A total of 9699 men were enrolled between 1984 and 1986. Blood samples were examined for <a title="Create this topic" rel="nofollow" class="foswikiNewLink" href="IgA.html">IgA</a> antibodies against EBV capsid antigen and neutralizing antibodies against EBV-specific DNase. During 131,981 person-years of follow-up, 22 pathologically confirmed new cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma that were diagnosed more than one year after recruitment were ascertained through linkage with the National Cancer Registry of Taiwan. </font>

<font color="steelblue"> <strong>RESULTS:</strong> The cumulative risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma per 100,000 person-years was 11.2 for subjects who tested positive for neither serologic marker, 45.0 for those who had one marker, and 371.0 for those who had both markers. After adjustment for age and the presence or absence of a family history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the relative risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 32.8 for subjects with both markers (95 percent confidence interval, 7.3 to 147.2; P&lt;0.001) and 4.0 for subjects with one marker (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.2; P=0.003), as compared with subjects with neither marker. </font>

<font color="steelblue">We examined incidence rates of pancreatic cancer in a prospective cohort study of women. During follow-up (1976-1998), there were 2.4 million years of person time, and 243 cases of pancreatic cancer were identified. </font>

<font color="steelblue">Clinical note: Virtually all cases of pancreatic cancer get diagnosed prior to death, and, unfortunately, most cases die shortly after diagnosis. </font>

<font color="steelblue">Q5-C: <em>If you learned that the study had missed 47 cases of pancreatic cancer among women who had been lost to follow-up, bias would be a concern. What are you concerned could be biased and in which direction?</em> </font>(Answers: <a title="Create this topic" href="TICRDisOccurIIAnswers.html" class="foswikiNewLink" rel="nofollow">TICR Disease Occurrence II - Answers</a><span class='foswikiBlackFG'>)</span> <br />
