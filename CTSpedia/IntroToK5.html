<li> Reviewers recognize that an individual with limited research experience is less likely to be able to prepare a research plan with the breadth and depth of that submitted by a more experienced investigator. 
</li> <li> Nevertheless, a fundamentally sound research plan must be provided. 
</li> <li> For candidates who require substantial didactic training as part of their program, the research plan may cover less than the full period of the award. 
</li></ul> 
<h2 id="Slide_3:_42Strategies_that_work_38_Mistakes_to_avoid_42">  Slide 3: <strong>Strategies that work &amp; Mistakes to avoid</strong> </h2> <ul>
<li> <strong>Build a team</strong>: Don't try to go it alone!  <ul>
<li> Seek opportunities for collaboration. 
</li> <li> Identify collaborators to fill gaps in your expertise, especially a mentor or collaborator who is well known. 
</li> <li> Consider multidisciplinary approaches. 
</li> <li> Recruit senior colleagues who can provide advice and <em>periodic</em> peer-review of your grant application (e.g., overall scope, specific aims, methods)

<li> <strong>Find a good idea</strong>: The idea must be creative, exciting, and worth funding.  <ul>
<li> Concentrate ideas in your area of expertise that would make an impact on public health. 
</li> <li> Do your homework; make sure your topic fills a gap in the existing literature. 
</li> <li> Pose interesting, testable hypotheses, whenever possible. 
</li> <li> Brainstorm potential topics with mentors and colleagues. 
</li> <li> Keep in mind that your topic should fit the mission of the NIH, which is to increase our understanding of biologic processess, diseases, treatments, or prevention. 
</li> <li> Just moving science forward is not enough; so, tie your science to curing, treating, or preventing disease. 
</li> <li> You will be judged on the likelihood that your research can make an impact on public health.

<li> <strong>Less is more</strong>: <em>Don't bite off more than you can chew!</em>  <ul>
<li> An overly ambitous grant application can make reviewers question your ability to achieve your goals and also to wonder whether the project has been thoroughly thought through with your mentors. 
</li> <li> Many grant applications are <strong><em>not funded</em></strong> because they propose to do <strong><em>too much</em></strong> and are viewed as <strong><em>lacking focus</em></strong>. 
</li> <li> For new investigators, reviewers will be more inclined to give you a fundable score if you bite off less work to do. 
</li> <li> Remember: Focus, focus, focus

<li> <strong>Don't procrastinate</strong>: <em>Time is your greatest resource and your most important asset.</em>  <ul>
<li> Get started early (at least 4-6 months before grant appliction is due). 
</li> <li> Make steady progress; arrange dedicated time each week for grant-writing. 
</li> <li> Get good peer review before you submit.

<li> <strong>3 key things to remember when designing a research plan for a K award.</strong>  <ol>
<li> The research plan is a training vehicle. The research plan should be well integrated with your career development training plan. 
</li> <li> The research plan is a means to achieve independence. The research plan should be viewed as a precursor for a subsequent R01. 
</li> <li> Mentored K awards provide <strong><em>limited funding</em></strong>. The scope of the research plan needs to be appropriate and feasible, given the modest resources available in a mentored K award. 
</li></ol> 
</li> <li> A %u201Cmodular%u201D approach is possible, which might include several small projects, such as secondary analyses of existing data, leveraging ongoing cohort studies or clinical trials, or conducting a small pilot study. 
</li></ul> 
<h2 id="Slide_8:_42Specific_Aims_42">  Slide 8: <strong>Specific Aims</strong> <a name="SpecificAims" title="SpecificAims"></a> </h2> <ul>
<li> Length: 1 page 
</li> <li> Style: Non-technical. Write this section for all study section members, since they%u2019ll all read it. 
</li> <li> Function: After reading a well-written Specific Aims section, a reviewer must understand the following:  <ul>
<li> The problem being addressed and the long-term goals of the research. 
</li> <li> The hypothesis(s) being tested. 
</li> <li> The methodologic approach and feasibility of the project. 
</li> <li> The potential impact of the findings. 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<h2 id="Slide_9:_42Specific_Aims_40cont_39d_41_42">  Slide 9: <strong>Specific Aims (cont'd)</strong> </h2> <ul>
<li> Introductory paragraph(s):  <ul>
<li> Begin by stating the general purpose or long-term goal of your research in terms of its relevance to the mission of the NIH (i.e., improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease). 
</li> <li> The long-term goal should be broad enough to give the impression that this study is part of a larger research plan that will continue beyond the bounds defined in the Specific Aims. 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Clearly state the problem to be addressed *Scope of the problem (describe importance of the problem, such as number of people affected, morbidity/mortality, costs to society).  <ul>
<li> Nature of the problem (what we don%u2019t know that we need to know in order to move forward; provides rationale for specific aims). 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Describe your methodologic approach to the problem (e.g., RCT, observational cohort, case-control study).  <ul>
<li> Describe <strong><em>scope</em></strong> of project and its <strong><em>feasibility</em></strong> (e.g., availability of subjects, leveraging existing resources or infrastructure). 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<h2 id="Slide_10:_42Specific_Aims_42">  Slide 10: <strong>Specific Aims</strong> </h2> <ul>
<li> Each aim should consist of one sentence: be concise, concrete, and operational. 
</li> <li> Keep the number of aims to a minimum (2-4). 
</li> <li> Aims should be able to %u201Cstand alone%u201D: keep aims related but independent of the successful outcomes of the previous aim. 
</li> <li> State interesting, testable hypotheses, whenever possible. 
</li> <li> Include rationales, when needed. 
</li></ul> 
<h2 id="Slide_11:_42Integration_of_research_plan_with_career_development_plan_42">  Slide 11: <strong>Integration of research plan with career development plan</strong> </h2>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<strong>At the end of the Specific Aims section, describe how the research plan is integrated with the career development plan (give concrete examples).</strong>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
"Each of these specific aims is designed to provide me with the necessary skills and experiences to become an independent health services researcher. My long-term goals are two-fold: (1) to develop interventions to help clinicians better prescribe warfarin, and (2) to better describe risk factors for poor warfarin outcomes in an effort to improve existing risk stratification tools.<br /><br />In <strong>Aim 1</strong>, the research plan will provide experience in longitudinal data analysis, propensity score analysis, outcomes assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and pharmacoepidemiology. <strong>Aim 2</strong> will provide experience in prospective data collection, development of an independent cohort, and assessment of patient functional status and frailty. <strong>Aim 3</strong> will provide experience developing a decision support intervention and obtain pilot data for the subsequent intervention study.<br /><br />Additionally, each of these aims clearly comprises a necessary precursor for my anticipated R01 application. For example, <strong>Aims 1 and 2</strong> will provide crucial data on the risk factors, rates, and outcomes of warfarin-associated hemorrhage. <strong>Aim 3</strong> will incorporate these data into a user-friendly decision tool that helps clinicians balance the risks and benefits of warfarin. <br /><br />Thus, this study will provide important pilot data in preparation for a larger practice-based intervention study investigating the effect of this decision tool on clinician prescribing of warfarin, patient understanding of the risks and benefits of warfarin, and on stroke and hemorrhage outcomes.
