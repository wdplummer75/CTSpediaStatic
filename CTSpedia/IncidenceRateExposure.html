<h2 id="Advantage_of_Using_Incident_Rates">  Advantage of Using Incident Rates </h2>
 There are a number of advantages to using <a href="StudyIncidencePersonTime.html">incident rates</a>. One of them is to look at incidence with time-varying exposures in persons while <a href="PredictorVariable.html">exposed</a> and not exposed..
<p></p>
<h2 id="Need_to_Determine_Time_45Varying_Exposure">  Need to Determine Time-Varying Exposure </h2>
<p></p>
<strong>Research question:</strong> In a Medicaid database is there an association between use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and coronary artery disease (CAD)?
<p></p>
<strong>How would you study the relationship between NSAID use and CAD?</strong>
<p></p>
This is a common type of problem in <a href="CohortStudy.html">cohort studies</a> that examine <a href="PredictorVariable.html">exposures</a> which can <strong>change over time</strong>, such as smoking, changes in diet, exercise, medications, etc. <ul>
<li> The database records time periods when medications were being used and time periods when they were not used.
</li> <li> Some persons will never use the medications and some will use it continuously, but there is a large group who either initiate or discontinue use during the time under study and another group who change in both directions.
</li> <li> The same person can go on and off the medication multiple times.
</li></ul> 
How would you analyze such data using the <a href="StudyIncidenceCumul.html">cumulative incidence</a>approach?
<p></p>
<h2 id="Calculating_Stratified_Person_45Time_Incidence_Rates">  Calculating Stratified Person-Time Incidence Rates </h2>
<p></p>
For persons followed in a cohort some potential risk factors may be <strong>fixed</strong> but some may be <strong>variable</strong> <ul>
<li> <strong>Fixed:</strong> gender
</li> <li> <strong>Variable:</strong> taking medications or getting regular exercise are behaviors that can change over time
</li></ul> 
Adding up person-time in an exposure category to get a denominator of time at risk is one way to deal with risk factors that change over time. 
<h3 id="Numerator_and_Denominator">  Numerator and Denominator </h3>
 For <a href="PredictorVariable.html">exposures</a> that are time-varying, adding up the total person-time of exposure and non-exposure to form two <strong>denominators</strong> is a very useful way of dealing with the problem of changing exposure groups.
<p></p>
The <strong>numerators</strong> for each denominator then become the number of events that occurred among persons at times when they were exposed and similarly for the events among the unexposed.
<h3 id="Assumptions">  Assumptions </h3>
<p></p>
This approach assumes that the exposure&rsquo;s effect on the event is predominately during the time the exposure is occurring. It therefore makes sense for <a href="PredictorVariable.html">exposures</a> whose association with the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">outcome</a> quickly disappears when the exposure is removed.
<p></p>
This <strong>assumption</strong> would not work very well for exposures which have lasting effects long after the actual exposure is removed. For an exposure like smoking with known long-term health risks, linking events to time periods when an individual was and was not smoking would probably assume too close a relationship between the time of exposure and the outcome.
<h2 id="Example:_NSAIDs_and_CHD">  Example: NSAIDs and CHD </h2>
<a href="EgTimeVarying.html">Ray</a> (2002) analyzed Medicaid recipients in Tennessee over a ten-year period to determine if there is a relationship between use of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and coronary heart disease (CHD). 
<p></p>
They calculated incidence rates during times of use and non-use that account for time of exposure. (The assumption is that NSAID use will have an immediate effect during usage in lowering the incidence of cardiovascular events.)
<p></p>
 <strong>Rate for NSAID use</strong> = 12.02 per 1000 pers-yrs
<p></p>
<strong>Rate for non use</strong> = 11.86 per 1000 pers-yrs
<p></p>
<strong>Rate ratio</strong> = 1.01
<p></p>
Concluded <strong>no evidence</strong> that NSAIDS reduced risk of CHD events.
<h3 id="Discussion">  Discussion </h3>
<p></p>
Ideally, this is a question that should be resolved by a clinical trial, but a clinical trial of this question may never be done. In the absence of a randomized trial, an observational <a href="CohortStudy.html">cohort study</a> is the second best choice.
<p></p>
Again, a <a href="CohortStudy.html">prospective cohort</a> with better measurements of all the potential confounders, in particular aspirin use, would be preferable, but to get the numbers required would mean a very large cohort followed for a number of years. Possible but very expensive.
<p></p>
Analyzing existing data is less desirable, but it does provide an opportunity to assemble a cohort analysis on a large number over many years at minimal expense.
<p></p>
The question that remains is whether they were able to get adequate control of <a href="BiasConfound.html">confounders</a>.
