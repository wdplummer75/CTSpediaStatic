To clarify and emphasize, my main point is just that if observed data x makes H more likely and makes H\x92 less likely, then x has supported H more than H\x92.  And this can happen even when H implies H\x92.  I used a simple, Bayesian example for clarity, but I think the problem is general.  An observation x can support H more than H\x92 if it is very incompatible with (H\x92 and not H).
<p></p>
I believe that Jeff is mistaken when he says that x is neutral by likelihood ratio for H vs H\x92 in my example.  The likelihood ratio P(x|H)/P(x|H\x92) is 2, and it cannot be calculated without using the priors (or at least the ratio P(A)/P(A or B)).

Peter\x92s example is very interesting, and he proposes a criterion for a sensible measure of support (evidence) in terms of prior versus posterior probabilities.  As these are related via the likelihood function, I think he is on the right track. A candidate measure of evidence is the likelihood ratio between two hypotheses.  If we have prior information on the probabilities of A, B and C it may be helpful (and sometimes necessary) to use it \x96 but such information is not necessary in this example to describe the relative evidence conveyed by the observation x about the hypotheses considered.   Suppose we do not have the priors.  The probability of x under each hypothesis is sufficient:
1) Having observed x, we know that B is false since P(x|B)=0
2) Now H=H\x92=A, so the observation x is clearly neutral evidence for H v H\x92:  It supports H\x92 at least as much as H, as required and as Peter noted.  It is also neutral regarding the hypothesis \x93C\x94 with respect to \x93A\x94.  (the probabilities of C and A have both increased by the factor 4/3 \x96 but is x evidence \x93for\x94 either in isolation? It IS definitive evidence for either over B)
Regardless of the prior probabilities of the hypotheses under consideration, if we can compute the probability of x under each hypothesis, we might measure the relative evidence for H1 v H2 by the likelihood ratio P(x|H1)/P(x|H2).  In Peter\x92s example, before taking the observation we would not have been able to compute P(x|H\x92) without the prior information \x96 it was fortunate that x ruled out B.
The p-value fails as a measure of support because it refers to only one hypothesis, and I suggest that a sensible measure of evidence must reflect relative support for &#62;1 hypothesis.  The rule \x93if P(H) &#60; P(H|x) then x is positive support for H\x94 conforms:  Though it refers directly only to H, P(H|x) depends on the probability of x under all alternatives in ~H as well as the priors on those alternatives.
If we change the example only by making P(x|B)=0.01 rather than 0, we DO need the prior odds on A v B to determine that P(x|H\x92)=0.505.  The likelihood ratio now tells us that x supports H over H\x92 by a factor of nearly 2, but that seems very wrong.  The problem is that the logical relationship between H and H\x92 is not encoded in the data.
The Bayesian calculation shows {P(H\x92|x)=0.3355}&#62;{P(H|x)=0.3333}.   Yet as before, P(H)&#60;P(H|x), while P(H\x92)&#62;P(H\x92|x).
Wow \x96 is Peter right?  Is the search for a measure of support that will always conform to logic for this problem doomed, even if we commit fully to Bayesianism?

Schervish proposes a &ldquo;simple logical condition&rdquo; that if hypothesis H implies hypothesis H&rsquo; then any observed data x must support H&rsquo; at least as much as it supports H. I believe that this is mistaken.
<p></p>
If H implies H&rsquo;, then we do have <br />P(H&rsquo;|x) &gt;= P(H|x), <br />but these posterior probabilities are not measures of how much x has supported H or H&rsquo;. I propose that such a measure should reflect how the probabilities given x differ from the prior probabilities before x was observed. Specifically, <br />if P(H) &gt; P(H|x) then x has provided negative support for H, and <br />if P(H) &lt; P(H|x) then x has provided positive support for H.
<p></p>
Even if H implies H&rsquo;, it can happen that <br />P(H|x) &gt; P(H) and <br />P(H&rsquo;|x) &lt; P(H&rsquo;). <br />In this case, x supports H (positive support) more than it supports H&rsquo; (negative support), violating Schervish&rsquo;s proposed condition, but no measure of support can meet it and still make any sense. This can happen in situations where x is fairly incompatible with the event (H&rsquo; &amp; not H) but fairly compatible with H.
<p></p>
A simple example is the following:
<p></p>
3 possible states of nature: A, B, or C <br />H: A <br />H&rsquo;: A or B <br />H implies H&rsquo; <br /><br />Prior probabilities:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(A) = 1/4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P(B) = 1/4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P(C) = 1/2 <br />Observed data probabilities: P(x|A) = 1 P(x|B) = 0 P(x|C) = 1<br /><br />Simple calculations show:
<p></p>
P(H|x) = P(A|x) = 1/3 &gt; 1/4 = P(H) <br />Any sensible measure of support must show positive support of x for H, because P(H|x) &gt; P(H)
<p></p>
P(H&rsquo;|x) = P(A or B | x) = 1/3 &lt; 1/2 = P(H&rsquo;) <br />Any sensible measure of support must show negative support of x for H&rsquo;, because P(H&rsquo;|x) &lt; P(H&rsquo;).
<p></p>
(Note that we do still have P(H&rsquo;|x) &gt;= P(H|x), which is the condition that must hold if H implies H&rsquo;.)
<p></p>
Therefore, no sensible measure of support can be &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; by the Schervish criterion. Showing that a measure violates this condition is therefore not necessarily a flaw in that measure, and any measure that meets this condition will not make sense in situations like the above.
<p></p>
This, of course, does not mean that P-values are sensible measures of support for the null hypothesis, but I believe that exposition based on Schervish&rsquo;s criterion will not be helpful.
<p></p>
The distinction between the posterior probability P(H|x) and the support that x provides for H is why the analogy with the coherence criterion for multiple comparisons does not hold. If H implies H&rsquo;, then it would not make sense to reject H&rsquo; but not reject H, because we must have P(H&rsquo;|x) &gt;= P(H|x). The multiple comparisons coherence criterion follows from the posterior probabilities, and does not depend on the support that x provides for H and H&rsquo;.
