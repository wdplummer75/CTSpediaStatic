<h2 id="Examining_a_Known_Confounder">  Examining a Known Confounder </h2>
 Testing for statistically significant differences (<a href="StudyAnalysisAdjustment.html">adjustment</a>) between crude and adjusted measures is inappropriate when:
<p></p>
<strong>Factor is a known confounder</strong>. <ul>
<li> e.g., examining an association for which a factor is a known confounder
</li> <li> age in the association between hypertension (HTN) and coronary artery disease (CAD)
</li></ul> 
Why don&rsquo;t we just apply a statistical test to see if the difference between the crude and adjusted measure of <a href="StudyAssoc.html">association</a> is significant? <strong>This is a bad idea</strong>. Even if you wanted to perform a statistical test, they are actually not available in software packages. 
<h2 id="Small_Sample_Size">  Small Sample Size </h2>
<p></p>
Testing for statistically significant differences (<a href="StudyAnalysisAdjustment.html">adjustment</a>) between crude and adjusted measures is inappropriate when:
<p></p>
The study has a small sample size, even large differences between crude and adjusted measures may not be statistically different. <ul>
<li> Yet, we know confounding is present.
</li> <li> Therefore, the difference between crude and adjusted measures cannot be ignored as merely chance.
</li> <li> <strong><a href="BiasConfound.html">Bias</a> must be prevented:</strong> the difference must be reported as confounding.
</li></ul> 
Why is statistical testing for confounding inappropriate?  <ul>
<li> Say you are working with a variable that you know is a confounder in every prior instance it was examined, like age in the evaluation of the relationship between hypertension and coronary artery disease.
</li></ul> 
What if you happened to have a small sample size in your study?  <ul>
<li> Then even large differences between the crude and adjusted measures of association might not be statistically significant.
</li> <li> What are you going to do?
</li> <li> Throw out age and just go with crude estimate of the relationship between hypertension and CAD?
</li> <li> Of course, you won&rsquo;t do this because you know that confounding is present!
</li></ul> 
You cannot ignore differences between crude and adjusted measures just because they are not statistically significant.  <ul>
<li> In other words, when protecting against bias, you have to do whatever you can regardless of statistical significance.
</li> <li> We have to live with what we see as differences between crude and adjusted regardless of the statistics.
</li></ul> 
<h2 id="Issue_of_Confounding_Is_Bias">  Issue of Confounding Is Bias </h2>
<p></p>
<strong>The issue of confounding is one of <a href="BiasConfound.html">bias</a>, not of sampling error.</strong> <ul>
<li> We must live with whatever effects we see after <a href="StudyAnalysisAdjustment.html">adjustment</a> for a factor for which there is a strong <em>a priori</em> belief about confounding.
</li> <li> We&rsquo;re not concerned that sampling error is causing confounding and therefore we don&rsquo;t have to worry about testing for role of chance
</li> <li> The exception to this are variables for which we are not sure <em>a priori</em> are confounders. For such variables, we need to weigh bias versus <a href="StudyAnalysisVariance.html">variance</a> tradeoffs.
</li></ul> 
Caveat: there may be a penalty in statistical <a href="PrecisionStudy.html">precision</a> when controlling for potential confounders. See the <a href="EgBiasDown.html">study of spermicide</a> use and Down Syndrome. 
<h2 id="Do_Not_Adjust">  Do Not Adjust </h2>
 If you <a href="StudyAnalysisAdjustment.html">adjust</a> for a factor that you don't need to adjust for, you will end up with much larger confidence intervals and a loss in <a href="PrecisionStudy.html">precision</a>. See <a href="EgNoAdjustMatches.html">Lung Cancer</a> and Matches Study.
<p></p>
<h2 id="Bias_45Variance_Tradeoff">  Bias-Variance Tradeoff </h2> <ul>
<li> What is a <strong><a href="StudyAnalysisVariance.html">meaningful difference</a></strong> between the crude and adjusted measure of <a href="StudyAssoc.html">association</a>?
</li> <li> Should you accept the <strong><a href="StratificationTerm.html">adjusted summary estimate</a></strong> as your final answer or the <strong><a href="StratificationTerm.html">crude estimate</a></strong>?
