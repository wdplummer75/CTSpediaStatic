This seems like a very difficult situation, but I think that the ethics are clear. The statement, &ldquo;The investigators then decided not to proceed with submission of this manuscript since it did not bode well for future grant applications,&rdquo; appears to indicate a deliberate suppression of evidence in order to favor personal financial and career considerations over scientific progress. The investigators apparently intend to pursue certain lines of research despite having evidence that they are unlikely to be fruitful, knowing that if reviewers were aware of this evidence they would be unlikely to fund such research. If this is really the case, then I would say that the investigators who made this decision are planning to defraud future funders of their research. They might not have fully thought this through and might change their minds with a little more discussion, particularly if limitations and uncertainty can be fairly emphasized in the paper.
<p></p>
If not, then the situation becomes practically very difficult. Working on projects that are unlikely to be fruitful is very undesirable, as is working for people who seem to have questionable priorities, but resentment from colleagues and the risk of unemployment are also very hard to face. I would recommend looking into whistleblower protections (local and federal), which I think could be investigated anonymously or confidentially. I would also look for another position. I believe that there are many investigators who would value this person&rsquo;s demonstration of scientific integrity and would understand the inability to get a recommendation from the current employer.
