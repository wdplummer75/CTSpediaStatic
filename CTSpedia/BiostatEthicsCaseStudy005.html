The first thing I would ask myself is: how serious of a flaw are we talking about?  Is it a different option in the statistical software that gives a slightly different answer? Is it a difference of opinion about the assumed distribution with no serious consequence? Or is it a much more serious flaw? One way to find out is to see whether the results of the claimed \x93flawed\x94 and \x93correct\x94 analyses are consistent?  It they are, then we\x92re probably (not surely) talking about a less serious flaw.  If they\x92re not, then (almost) by definition, one of the two methods has a serious flaw.  
About a month ago, we ran into a very similar situation where a trial PI was insisting that his method was correct (p-value around 0.04), and our coordinating center\x92s statistician thought it was not the correct way.  According to the statistician, the correct method leads to a different result (p-value around 0.15).  The PI was trying to convince us that both ways could be correct.  My response was that if both approaches are indeed correct, then the field of Statistics is a useless field.  
After a little bit of research, it became clear that the PI\x92s approach was indeed flawed, and the PI was convinced.
Back to the posted case: the text says that the statistician\x92s \x93statistical analysis yields a result contrary to the scientist\x92s result\x94, which means that we are talking about a serious flaw.  In such case, the statistician should ask her supervisor to sign off since he believes that it should be signed off.  I would think that the signature of the statistician\x92s supervisor has at least as much weight as the statistician\x92s signature.  If not, then something more important is not quite right in that organization.
