<p></p>
When we say the <a href="BiasConfound.html">confounder</a> has to be "associated with the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">disease</a>" - what do we mean?
<p></p>
A confounding variable can be either:
<p></p>
(1) A "cause" or "marker" of the <strong>disease</strong> (arrow pointing from the confounder to the disease):
<blockquote>
<p></p>
(a) <a href="#CauseDisease" class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink">Cause of the disease</a> (arrow pointing from the confounder to the disease)
</blockquote> <blockquote>
<p></p>
(b) <a class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink" href="#MarkerDisease">Marker for the disease</a> (arrow pointing from the confounder through other factors to disease)
</blockquote> <blockquote> (c) <a class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink" href="#CauseDisExp">Cause of the disease and</a> the <a href="PredictorVariable.html">exposure</a> (one arrow from the confounder to disease and another arrow from confounder to exposure) </blockquote>
<p></p>
(2) <a href="#NoncauDis" class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink">Associated in a non-causal manner</a> with the <strong>disease</strong> (double-headed arrow from the confounder to the disease)

<strong>Given the research question</strong>: Is injection drug use associated with survival independent of effect on hepatitis infections?
<p></p>
Consider the diagram above where we are looking at the causal relationship between the confounder and the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">outcome</a>.
<p></p>
Here, the research question is whether injection drug is associated with survival independent of the effect on causing hepatitis infections. <ul>
<li> We might perhaps hypothesize an effect of IDU on survival working through an increased frequency of bacterial infections.
</li> <li> To determine this, we wish to know if this is independent of hepatitis B and C virus infection which by themselves can cause cirrhosis and early death.
</li> <li> This is an example where the <strong>potential confounder causes the outcome (C causes D)</strong>.
</li></ul>

<strong>Given the research question:</strong> Is birth order associated with Down Syndrome independent of maternal age?
<p></p>
Consider the diagram above.
<p></p>
In the past, there has been a question about whether birth order is associated with Down syndrome. <ul>
<li> Of course, we need to take into maternal age before considering an independent role for birth order.
</li> <li> This is because <strong>maternal age is associated with birth order and we also know it is a strong risk factor for Down Syndrome</strong>.
</li></ul> 
But age per se is just a statement about passage of time and it itself is not the cause of Down Syndrome.  <ul>
<li> The <strong>accumulation of time, or age, is undoubtedly associated with some biologic factor</strong> that is the cause of Down Syndrome.
</li> <li> We don't know yet what this specific biologic factor is, but to ignore age as a potential confounder in the relationship between birth order and Down Syndrome would be a terrible mistake.
</li></ul> 
NOTE: Some textbooks are adamant about a factor must be a cause of the outcome to be a confounder; don't get too hung up on what exactly a <em>cause</em> is.

 <strong>Given the research question:</strong> Is anti-retroviral drugs for HIV associated with cardio-vascular disease? <blockquote>
<p></p>
<img alt="0401_2HIV.JPG" height="238" width="215" src="BiasConfoundDisease.attachments/0401_2HIV.JPG">
</blockquote>
<p></p>
One thing that the new antiretroviral agents do is to prolong survival, ie people live longer. <ul>
<li> But with <strong>longer life comes increased risk for many diseases</strong>, including cardiovascular disease.
</li> <li> This again illustrates how <strong>age is powerful confounding factor for many situations</strong>.

<strong>Given the reserach question:</strong> Is anti-depressant use in children associated with suicide independent of depression?
<p></p>
As you can see in the diagram below this is easy relationship to visualize.
<p></p>
Typically, such kids suffer from <strong>depression (confounder)</strong>: <ul>
<li> A causal factor in <strong>suicide (<a href="OutcomeVariable.html">disease</a>)</strong> and
</li> <li> Treated with <strong>anti-depressants (<a href="PredictorVariable.html">exposure</a>)</strong>.
</li></ul>

<strong>Given the research question:</strong> Is sexual activity associated with survival independent of general health?
<p></p>
Consider the diagram above on the non-causal relationship between the confounder and the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">disease</a>.
<p></p>
Here, it looks like the <strong>confounder is "general health"</strong> that we might measure, for example, on a quality of life survey. <ul>
<li> Yet, the <strong>real factor to consider is unknown biological factors that causes both good <em>general health</em> and an impact on mortality</strong>.
</li></ul> 
This is a bit of a semantical issue.  <ul>
<li> Most texts do not use this double-headed arrow when describing the possible relationship between the confounder and the disease
</li> <li> but in many cases the "confounder" is just a marker for the real biologic factor that is associated with the disease.
</li></ul> 
Sometimes people get confused by this and <strong>don't consider factors that are markers for true causes to be potential confounders.</strong>
