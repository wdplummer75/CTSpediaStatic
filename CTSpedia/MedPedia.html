The Medpedia Project is a long-term, worldwide project to evolve a new model for sharing and advancing knowledge about health, medicine and the body among medical professionals and the general public. This model is founded on providing a free online technology platform that is collaborative, interdisciplinary and transparent. Read more about the model.
<p></p>
Users of the platform include physicians, consumers, medical and scientific journals, medical schools, research institutes, medical associations, hospitals, for-profit and non-profit organizations, expert patients, policy makers, students, non-professionals taking care of loved ones, individual medical professionals, scientists, etc.
<p></p>
As Medpedia grows over the next few years, it will become a repository of up-to-date unbiased medical information, contributed and maintained by health experts around the world, and freely available to everyone. The information in this clearinghouse will be easy to discover and navigate, and the technology platform will expand as the community invents more uses for it.
<p></p>
In association with Harvard Medical School, Stanford School of Medicine, Berkeley School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medical School and other leading global health organizations, Medpedia will be a commons for the gathering of the information and people critical to health care. Many organizations have united to support The Medpedia Project. See the Record of Merit. Medpedia is a technology platform &ndash; what&rsquo;s available today About
<p></p>
Version 1.0 of the online Medpedia platform was released in beta on Feb 17, 2009. At the time three interrelated collaborative services were operational: 1) a collaborative encyclopedia or knowledge base (a wiki), 2) a Network &amp; Directory for health professionals and organizations, and 3) Communities of Interest where medical professionals and non-professionals can share information.
