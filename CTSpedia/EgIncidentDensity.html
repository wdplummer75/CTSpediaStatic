The abstract below (<a href="#KroppIncidentDensity" class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink">Kropp</a>) is an example from a study using incidence-density sampling.
<p></p>
<blockquote> <em>"In a population-based case-control study in Germany, the authors determined the effect of alcohol consumption at low-to-moderate levels on breast cancer risk among women up to age 50 years. The study included <font color="maroon">706 case women whose breast cancer had been newly diagnoses in 1992-1995 and 1,381 residence- and age-matched controls.</font> In multivariate conditional logistical regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratio for breast cancer were 0.71 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54, 0.91) for average ethanol intake of 1-5 g/day. 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.91) for intake of 6-11 g/day, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.05) for 12-18 g/day, 1.10 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.65) for 19-30 g/day, and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.18, 3.20) for &gt;= 31 g/day."</em>
<p></p>
<em>"These data suggest that low-level consumption of alcohol does not increase breast cancer risk in premenopausal women."</em>

<h3 id="Study_Design">  Study Design </h3>
 <strong>Matching on calendar date tells you that they used <a href="SampleIncidence.html">incidence density sampling</a>.</strong>
<p></p>
The study was carried out in the primary <a href="StudyBase.html">study base</a> of an area of Germany; <ul>
<li> all new cases of breast cancer during a four-year period were identified;
</li> <li> two controls were selected from the population at the time of each diagnosis (incidence density sampling),  <ul>
<li> who were also matched on area of residence and age group.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
This has become a very popular design in cancer epidemiology that makes use of a cancer registry to capture nearly all of the cases in a geographic area and the <strong>area population becomes a very good primary <a href="StudyBase.html">study base</a></strong>.

<p></p>
<a class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink" href="#FlickIncidentDensity">Flick</a> examines the association between long-term use of NSAIDs and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The study parameters are:
<p></p>
<strong><a href="CaseControlStudy.html">Case-Control Study</a></strong>: In an ongoing population-based case control study in the SF Bay Area.
<p></p>
<strong><em><a href="StudyCase.html">Cases</a></em></strong> were identified using <a href="EgCumulIncidenceSEER.html">Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results</a> registry data.
<p></p>
<strong><cite><a href="StudyControl.html"></cite></strong><cite> <strong>Controls</a></strong> were a random sample of persons identified by random digit dialing;</cite> <ul>
<li> resided in the same six counties as the cases at the time of diagnosis;
</li> <li> frequency-matched to cases by sex, age, and county of residence to ensure that they were from the same <a href="StudyBase.html">study base</a> as the cases.
</li></ul> 
<p></p>
<h3 id="Findings:">  Findings: </h3>
 After adjustment for age and sex, there was no consistent association between long-term use and NHL for all NSAIDs combined, aspirin, nonselective NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors.
<p></p>
<a href="SampleIncidence.html">Incidence density sampling</a> in <a href="CaseControlStudy.html">case-control design</a> has become very popular in cancer epidemiology, and this is a typical example. There are many similar studies in the recent cancer literature.
<p></p>
The study base for this research was six SF Bay Area counties. <ul>
<li> These counties are covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, the NCI-funded population-based registry that aims to identify all new cancer diagnoses and follow them for long-term outcomes (End Results).
</li></ul> 
Since the implicit <a href="StudyCohort.html">cohort</a> that gave rise to all the NHL diagnoses during the period these data were collected (from 2001 to 2004) was all the residents of those counties,  <ul>
<li> the controls were randomly selected from the same counties.
</li></ul> 
Incidence density sampling is indicated by selecting the controls by random-digit dialing &ldquo; <em>at the time of diagnosis</em> &rdquo; of the case to which the control was matched.  <ul>
<li> Matching on age and sex is common in cancer studies because they are strong <a href="BiasConfound.html">confounders</a> of cancer risk and matching increases the study&rsquo;s efficiency.
</li> <li> Matching on county serves to focus further the study base concept by regarding cases and controls in each of the six counties as subcohorts of the overall study.
</li></ul>
