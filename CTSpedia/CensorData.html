<h2 id="Three_Ways_Censoring_Occurs">  Three Ways Censoring Occurs </h2>
<p></p>
<strong>1) Death</strong> (if death is not the study outcome)
<p></p>
<strong>2) Loss to follow-up</strong> (refuse, move, or cannot be found)
<p></p>
<strong>3) End of study observation</strong> (if still alive and have not experienced outcome)
<p></p>
<strong>Each subject either experiences the outcome or is censored.</strong>
<p></p>
NOTE: To censoring caused by death we could also add diagnosis of another disease that makes the subject ineligible for further follow-up for the main disease under study. Such diagnoses would be specified in advance as censoring event.
<h2 id="Concept_of_Censoring_Observations">  Concept of Censoring Observations </h2>
<p></p>
Individuals in a study usually start at different times but may drop out before the end of the study, or may experience the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">outcome</a> (e.g. death) before the end of the study. <ul>
<li> In the diagram below from <a href="#SzkloEpi" class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink">Szklo and Nieto</a> a hypothetical example of a 10 person <a href="CohortStudy.html">cohort study</a> is given.
</li></ul> 
It illustrates:  <ul>
<li> How the individuals in the study started at different times,
</li> <li> Dropped out before the end of the study, or
</li> <li> Experienced the outcome (death in this example) before the end of the study
</li></ul>

<p></p>
NOTE: <ul>
<li> The times persons enter and leave the cohort are being shown on a calendar time scale.
</li> <li> The solid black bars represent the length of time each person was followed in the study.
</li> <li> D = death
</li> <li> C = censored observation, which means  <ul>
<li> The subject either was lost to follow-up,
</li> <li> Refused to participate further in the study, or
</li> <li> Continued until the study was ended.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
Person number 5 was enrolled at the very beginning and was still in the study at the end. Because this person was the only one with the full 24 months of study follow-up the text does not show this person as censored. I have added a "C" to the figure because when these data are coded for analysis, each person must be coded as either dead or censored. There is no other possibility. For the analysis there is a single variable that indicates whether each person died or didn't die. In terms of the analysis it doesn't matter why a person is censored.
<p></p>
<span id="AdministrativeCensoring"></span>
<p></p>
The <em>C</em> for persons still in the study at 24 months, the end of the study in calendar time, is often called <strong>administrative censoring</strong>. In terms of the analysis it doesn't matter why a person is censored.
<p></p>
In this example, death is the outcome, but in studies with a disease diagnosis outcome death becomes a censoring event since it removes that individual for further follow-up.
<p></p>
<span id="InformCensor"></span>
<h2 id="Censoring_Is_Unrelated_to_Survival">  Censoring Is Unrelated to Survival </h2>
<p></p>
<strong>Censoring is unrelated to the probability of experiencing the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">outcome</a> (unrelated to survival).</strong>
<p></p>
This concept is related to the threats to validity in a <a href="CohortStudy.html">cohort study</a> that come from <a href="LostToFollowUp.html">losses to follow-up</a>. Those persons lost to follow-up are the persons who are censored in the data analysis, so if the goal is to get an unbiased measure of incidence, those losses to follow-up cannot be related to the probability of the <a href="OutcomeVariable.html">outcome</a>. If members of the cohort who are leaving are either more or less likely to experience the outcome than those remaining, the <a href="StudyIncidence.html">incidence estimate</a> will be either too high or too low.
<p></p>
<span id="InformativeCensoring"></span>
<p></p>
<h2 id="Example_of_Informative_Censoring">  Example of Informative Censoring </h2>
<p></p>
This figure from <a class="foswikiCurrentTopicLink" href="#BraitsteinCensor">Braitstein 2006</a> presents the cumulative probability of death for HIV patients in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) programs in low-income countries based on active or passive follow-up. Active follow-up consisted of telephone calls, mailings, or both.

</blockquote>
<p></p>
As one can see there is a large difference in the cumulative probability for those on active versus passive follow-up. The authors then remove (informative censoring) those on passive follow-up from further study.
