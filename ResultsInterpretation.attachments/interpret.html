    <h1>Interpretation of Relative Risk</h1>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
Enter the estimated relative risk from your study, along with the
	confidence limits, into the table below. 
</p>
<p>
Interpretation requires assessing whether the estimated effect would
	be large enough to be important if it turned out to be exactly
	right. "Important" can mean important for patients, for public
	health, or for scientific understanding. Similar assessments
	are also needed for the confidence bounds.  Use the pull-down
	menus to provide these assessments.
</p>
<p>
When you have filled in all the values, suggested text appears below
	the table. You can change the values and the text will be
	rewritten appropriately. You will likely need to adapt it
	further for your circumstances.
